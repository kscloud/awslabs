# Simple Storage Service (S3)

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service. S3 is a webservice that presents a REST API for managing the objects.

## Characteristics

* Files 0 bytes to 5TB
* No storage limits (virtually)
* Supports versioning
* Supports multi-part upload (uploading single big file in multiple chunks) - for files larger than 5GB multi-part upload is required
* Multiple storage tiers
* Supports lifecycle management commands

## Consistency model

* Read after Write consistency for PUT's of new objects
* Eventual consistency for overwrite PUT's and DELETEs

## Storage Tiers 

* S3 Standard - ideal for data accessed pretty often. Durability 99.999999999% across multiple AZ, Availability 99.99% 
* S3 Standard-IA - ideal for data accessed less frequently, but require rapid access when needed. Durability 99.999999999% across multiple AZ, Availability 99.9%
* S3 One Zone-IA - ideal for data accessed less frequently, but require rapid access when needed. Data stored in one AZ only (ideal for storing that that can be regenerated in case of failure - e.g. thumbnails). Durability 99.999999999% in single az, Availability 99.5%
* S3 Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep Archive - ideal for creating data archives which does not require immediate access. 

Using `S3 lifecycle rules` objects within a bucket can be moved across different available storage Tiers. 

Example rules:
* All objects not accessed during last 30 days are moved to **S3 Standard-IA** storage class
* All objects older than 2 weeks are deleted
